  # a LoadBalancer makes this service available over the public internet

  # this works because we have cloudprovider=aws set on the cluster
  # this actually provisions AWS Elastic Load Balancing https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/
  # try running "kubectl get service web -o wide" after you create the Service
  # You'll get a lengthy DNS name which you can use with a DNS CNAME entry with your own domain
  # like http://xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com/
  # this is where the PHP app will be publicly viewable
